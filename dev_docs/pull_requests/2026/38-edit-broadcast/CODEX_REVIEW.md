- [comments_component.ex:961](</Users/maxdon/Desktop/Elixir-servers/max-dev/phoenix_kit_comments/lib/phoenix_kit_comments/web/comments_component.ex:961>) — A subscribed host receives `:updated` twice: `update_comment/3` broadcasts through PubSub, which includes the sender, then line 971 directly sends the identical message to `self()`. This can trigger duplicate reloads or side effects. Fix: use `broadcast_from` to exclude the caller while retaining the direct host notification.

No other concrete defects found. The update broadcasts after `Repo.update/1` returns, the new message contract is documented, and `broadcast: false` is covered at [edit_broadcast_test.exs:43](</Users/maxdon/Desktop/Elixir-servers/max-dev/phoenix_kit_comments/test/integration/edit_broadcast_test.exs:43>). Tests were not run.
