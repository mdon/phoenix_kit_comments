defmodule PhoenixKitComments.Web.CommentsComponent do
  @moduledoc """
  Reusable LiveComponent for displaying and managing comments on any resource.

  ## Usage

      <.live_component
        module={PhoenixKitComments.Web.CommentsComponent}
        id={"comments-\#{@post.uuid}"}
        resource_type="post"
        resource_uuid={@post.uuid}
        current_user={@current_user}
      />

  ## Required Attrs

  - `resource_type` - String identifying the resource type (e.g., "post")
  - `resource_uuid` - UUID of the resource
  - `current_user` - Current authenticated user struct
  - `id` - Unique component ID

  ## Optional Attrs

  - `enabled` - Whether comments are enabled (default: true)
  - `show_likes` - Show like/dislike buttons (default: true)
  - `title` - Section title (default: "Comments")
  - `rich_text` - Use the rich-text (Leaf) editor in the composer
    (default: the `comments_rich_text` setting, which defaults to `true`).
    Pass `false` to force the plain `<textarea>` — useful when the host
    hasn't registered Leaf's JS hook, since the Leaf editor otherwise hangs
    on its loading text with no server-side error. See the README's
    "JavaScript wiring" section.

  ## Slots

  - `:form_extras` - Custom markup rendered inside the new-comment form. Use it to
    inject parent-project inputs whose names are `metadata[<key>]`; their values are
    merged into `comment.metadata` on submit. The `"giphy"` key is reserved for the
    built-in Giphy picker, and any key listed in `decoration_keys` is dropped —
    a client may not claim the link between a comment and one of your records.
    Make that link server-side, in your own `create_comment/4` call.

        <:form_extras>
          <input type="color" name="metadata[box_color]" value="#ff5555" />
        </:form_extras>

  ## Parent Notifications

  After create/edit/delete, sends to the parent LiveView:

      {:comments_updated, %{resource_type: "post", resource_uuid: uuid, action: :created | :updated | :deleted}}

  The same message (plus `action: :reaction`) arrives over PubSub for
  changes made elsewhere — `PhoenixKitComments.subscribe/2` — so one
  `handle_info` clause covers both. A host rendering a preview or count of
  the resource's comments should reload on ANY action rather than matching
  a subset.

  # ── Leaf editor integration ──────────────────────────────────
  # Leaf (the optional rich-text editor) is a LiveComponent that
  # sends `{:leaf_changed, %{editor_id, markdown, html}}` to
  # `self()` — i.e. the parent LiveView process, NOT the
  # CommentsComponent (which is itself a LiveComponent). Host LVs
  # that embed CommentsComponent must catch those messages and
  # call `forward_leaf_event/2` so the component can keep its
  # draft / edit assigns in sync. Without forwarding, Leaf still
  # works visually but the form has no content to submit.
  #
  # ## Host wiring (one-liner per LiveView)
  #
  #     def handle_info({:leaf_changed, _} = msg, socket) do
  #       PhoenixKitComments.Web.CommentsComponent.forward_leaf_event(msg, socket)
  #     end
  #
  # ## Editor ID namespace
  #
  # The component owns the editor IDs and gates them with
  # `"pk-comments:<component_id>:..."` so the forwarder routes
  # only its own events. Other Leaf instances in the same host LV
  # (e.g. a post-content editor) are passed through unchanged via
  # `:pass`, letting the host's own handler match them.

  @doc """
  Forward a Leaf content-changed message from a host LiveView's
  `handle_info` into the comments component. Routes only events
  whose `editor_id` starts with `"pk-comments:"`; returns `:pass`
  for unrelated editors so the caller can fall through to its own
  handler.

  ## Example

      def handle_info({:leaf_changed, _} = msg, socket) do
        PhoenixKitComments.Web.CommentsComponent.forward_leaf_event(msg, socket)
      end

  Returns `{:noreply, socket}` on a match (already wrapped, ready
  to return from handle_info), or `:pass` when the editor isn't
  ours.
