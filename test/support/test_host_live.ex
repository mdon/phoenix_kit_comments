defmodule PhoenixKitComments.Test.HostLive do
  @moduledoc """
  A minimal host page that embeds `CommentsComponent`, the way a consuming
  application does.

  The admin LiveViews in `test/integration/` cover the moderation screens.
  They cannot cover the component: it is a `live_component` with its own
  event handlers, and its riskiest behaviour — the module kill switch, the
  viewer's role, and which parts of a submitted payload are allowed to reach
  `comment.metadata` — only exists inside a host. Without a host page, those
  paths had no test at all, which is how a client-supplied metadata key that
  links a comment to somebody else's record went unnoticed.

  `:decoration_keys` is passed through from the URL so a test can host the
  component the way core's MediaCanvasViewer does (declaring
  `"annotation_uuid"`) or the way a host that declares nothing does.
