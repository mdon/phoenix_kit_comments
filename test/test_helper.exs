# Test helper for PhoenixKitComments.
#
# Two levels:
#
#   * unit — schemas, changesets, pure functions, the markdown sanitiser.
#     Always run, no database needed.
#   * integration — tagged `:integration` via `PhoenixKitComments.DataCase`,
#     excluded automatically when PostgreSQL is unavailable.
#
# First-time setup:
#
#   createdb phoenix_kit_comments_test
#
# The comments tables live in CORE's versioned chain, not in this module —
# so the schema is built by `PhoenixKit.Migration.ensure_current/2`, the
# same call a host app makes. There is no module-owned DDL to run after it.
