defmodule PhoenixKitComments.Web.ModerationLiveTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The moderation admin page, driven through the real LiveView.

  This file exists because of what shipped without it. Approve and Restore
  were wired to each other's context functions: with moderation on, Approve
  called `restore_comment/2` and left the comment `pending` while flashing
  "Comment approved", and Restore called `approve_comment/2` and published a
  deleted comment that had never been approved. Every context-layer test
  passed throughout — `approve_comment/2` and `restore_comment/2` were both
  correct in isolation. Only clicking the button catches it.

  So each test asserts the RESULTING STATUS and the audit row's `action`
  **and** `actor_uuid`. Asserting merely that some row exists would pass
  against the swapped wiring, and asserting the status alone would pass
  against a handler that drops the actor.
